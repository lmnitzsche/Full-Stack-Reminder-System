# Enable Email for All Users - Resend Domain Setup

## Current Status
- ✅ Telegram: Working for all users (unlimited, free)
- ⚠️ Email: Only works for your Resend signup email (logannitzsche1@gmail.com)

## To Enable Email for ALL Users:

### Option 1: Verify Your Own Domain (Best)

1. **Go to Resend Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://resend.com/domains
   - Click "Add Domain"

2. **Choose a Domain**
   - If you have a domain (e.g., `myapp.com`), enter it
   - Don't have a domain? Get a free one:
     - Vercel: Free subdomain with deployment
     - Freenom: Free domains
     - Use a subdomain of an existing domain

3. **Add DNS Records**
   Resend will show you 3 DNS records to add:
   ```
   Type: TXT
   Name: resend._domainkey
   Value: [provided by Resend]
   
   Type: TXT  
   Name: @
   Value: v=spf1 include:resend.com ~all
   
   Type: TXT
   Name: _dmarc
   Value: [provided by Resend]
   ```

4. **Wait for Verification**
   - Usually takes 5-15 minutes
   - Check status in Resend dashboard

5. **Update the Function**
   - Edit `supabase/functions/send-reminders/index.ts`
   - Change line with `from:` to:
     ```typescript
     from: 'Task Tracker <reminders@yourdomain.com>'
     ```
   - Deploy: `supabase functions deploy send-reminders`

6. **Test!**
   - Create a reminder
   - Email will be sent to ANY user's email address

### Option 2: Keep Using Test Mode (Development Only)

If you just want to test with your own email:
- Emails only go to: `logannitzsche1@gmail.com`
- Change your app's user email to match
- Other users won't receive emails
